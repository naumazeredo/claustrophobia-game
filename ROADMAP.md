# Ideas / Not decided

- Attacks inside hull move in slow mode
- Boss shoot lasers to the sides
- Usable: Blank shot
- Usable: Dash (player moves forward, hull teleports/moves with player and kills
    enemies inside)
- Power up: extra shots
- Power up: wide shots
- Power up: piercing shots
- Joystick controls
- Free aim / Free movement

# Decided

## To do
- X levels (+ new game plus, if we have time)
- 8 directions (instead of free move)
- Ranking system: show enemies killed, damage taken and the ranking (FEDCBASP)
- Scripted levels

## Ignored
- XXX Deform hull (test spring) (use a single sprite for hull and shader to match)
